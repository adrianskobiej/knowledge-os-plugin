# AGENTS.md — knowledge base (knowledge-os)

> Every AI assistant (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor…) reads this file when it
> opens this directory. It describes what this base is and how to work with it — with no
> tool-specific install. The `/kb-*` commands are just convenient shortcuts for the
> procedures below; if your tool doesn't have them, run the steps by hand.

## What this is

A company knowledge base. The source of truth is `.md` files with frontmatter in:
`projects/`, `skills/`, `people/`, `meetings/`, `concepts/`, `departments/`. From them we generate:
- `INDEX.md` — root map (zones + counts + "Start here" + briefs). **Read it FIRST.**
- `<zone>/INDEX.md` — per-zone listing (one line/article) for large-base navigation.
- `kb-data.js` — data for `viewer.html` (the human-facing reader, offline).

These are generated and in `.gitignore` — never edit them by hand. The hand-written
always-on context lives in `CONTEXT.md` (core) and `now.md` (current focus).

**Language: English only.** All knowledge-base content (articles, templates, decisions, logs)
is written in English, even if the conversation with the user happens in another language.

## What goes here (and what does NOT)

This holds ONLY distilled knowledge (.md): decisions, processes, facts, people, lessons.
It is NOT a project store. Never copy project source code, whole files, or repositories
here. Projects stay where they are (scattered across disk) — you only SAVE knowledge from
them into this base. Do the work in the project's own folder; save the knowledge here.

Safety by default: the base uses a whitelist `.gitignore` — everything is ignored unless
explicitly allowed. Only the knowledge zones are shared; stray files and the raw source in
`raw/` stay local and are never pushed. Leaking something requires an explicit edit.

## Golden rule for the assistant — navigate, don't load everything

The base is built to stay fast even when it is very large. Navigate top-down:

1. **`CONTEXT.md`** (+ **`now.md`**) — always read first: who the owner is, goals, active work,
   preferences, current focus. This is your standing context.
2. **`INDEX.md` (root map)** — zones with counts + "Start here" + briefs. Do NOT expect every
   article here; at scale the root only shows the map.
3. **Zone index** — open the relevant `<zone>/INDEX.md` (e.g. `projects/INDEX.md`) for its
   one-line-per-article listing; pick 1–5 by `summary`/`tags`. For a very large zone this file is a
   small **TOC of pages** (`<zone>/INDEX.pN.md`, ≤150 articles each) with title ranges — open the
   page you need, or better, grep.
4. **Articles** — open only those, then follow `[[slug]]` links.

Every generated file is size-bounded (root map ~1 KB, zone TOC ~1 KB, each page ≤ ~35 KB) so no
single read blows up your context, no matter how big the base gets. `INDEX-facets.md` and `GAPS.md`
are **grep targets** — grep them for the tag/entity/term you want; don't load them whole.

**Precise lookup at scale:** instead of loading indexes, **grep** the base for a name/term across
`summary`/title/tags (e.g. `rg -i "acme" */*.md`), then open the hits. Index = the map; grep =
the lookup.

## Every agent works the same way (multi-agent contract)

This base is tool-agnostic — Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex, Claude Cowork all follow the
SAME rules. Regardless of which agent you are:

- **Know the user first.** Read the owner / primary-user profile in `people/` (goals, active
  projects, stack, working style) before acting — it's the context every agent should have.
- **New project = a structured article.** When a new project appears, create
  `projects/<slug>.md` from `_templates/project.md`. It MUST carry: **What it is**, **Goal**,
  **Status**, repo/dir/URL, **✅ in-scope (how agents should help)** and
  **⛔ non-goals (what agents must NOT do)**. Non-goals are a **HARD boundary** — do not act
  in those areas without explicit user approval.
- **Record knowledge, not a changelog.** Save durable, reusable knowledge by refining the
  relevant article IN PLACE (overwrite/improve — don't append change-by-change). Code diffs
  belong in the project's own git, not here.
- **Log your work in one line.** Append a single line to `wiki/log/log-<author>.md` noting what
  you did and which agent you are, e.g. `2026-06-23 [antigravity] — …`. One file per author →
  no merge conflicts.
- **Decisions** that change how we work → a new `D-NNN` entry in `wiki/decisions.md`.

## Workflow (procedures = /kb-* commands)

- **Query** (`/kb-query <question>`): read `INDEX.md` → open the relevant articles →
  answer concisely, citing file paths. Weigh `authority` (`primary` > `secondary` >
  `derived`). Surface contradictions, don't resolve them.
- **Find** (`/kb-find <term|tag|entity>`): precise lookup, especially in a large base.
  **Search by meaning, not just the literal words** — things aren't always written the way they're
  asked. Do this (it's semantic search using YOU as the engine, no vector DB):
  1. **Expand the query first.** From the user's intent, brainstorm 3–8 synonyms / related terms /
     likely phrasings. Use the glossary (if present) to map concepts to the base's actual terms.
  2. **Grep all of them**, e.g. `rg -i "lead|prospecting|acquisition|crm" */*.md`, and check `aka:`
     aliases. Or open `INDEX-facets.md` to jump by tag/entity.
  3. **Open the hits**, judge relevance by meaning, follow `[[links]]`. If still nothing, scan the
     relevant `<zone>/INDEX.md` summaries and reason about which fit — don't stop at literal misses.
- **Add knowledge** (`/kb-ingest [path|topic]`): read the raw material from `raw/`, check
  `INDEX.md` and the target folder's `BRIEF.md`, write article(s) `.md` with full
  frontmatter (models in `_templates/`), link via `[[slug]]`, then run reindex.
- **New project onboarding** (`/kb-new-project [name|repo]`): when a new project is created,
  do NOT silently write a stub — **interview the user first**, then fill
  `_templates/project.md`. Ask (and don't invent — mark anything unknown `⚠ TBD`):
  1. **Name + slug** (kebab-case).
  2. **What it is** — the project in 2–3 sentences.
  3. **Goal** — the outcome; definition of "done".
  4. **Status** — active / on hold / done.
  5. **Repo / dir / URL** — GitHub, path on disk, production URL.
  6. **Stack** — key technologies / services / accounts.
  7. **✅ In scope** — how agents should help.
  8. **⛔ Out of scope (non-goals)** — a **HARD boundary**; agents do not act there without
     explicit approval.
  9. **Relations** — `[[slug]]` links to people / other projects / skills.

  Prefer asking interactively (an options/question UI if the tool has one; otherwise a numbered
  list). Then: propose the filled article (path + content), get an explicit OK, write
  `projects/<slug>.md`, run reindex, and log one line in `wiki/log/log-<author>.md`.
- **Health-check** (`/kb-lint`): `node scripts/reindex.mjs --lint` — missing fields, dead
  links, orphans, duplicates, protected-quote signals.
- **Sync** (`/kb-sync`): `git pull --rebase --autostash` → reindex (integrates teammates' work without losing yours).
- **Deploy** (`/kb-deploy`): reindex --lint → `git add -A` → commit → `git pull --rebase --autostash` → push.

## Engine commands (work in every tool)

```
node scripts/reindex.mjs                 # rebuild INDEX.md + kb-data.js
node scripts/reindex.mjs --lint          # health-check only, no writes
node scripts/reindex.mjs --bless-quotes  # approve protected quotes (quotes.json)
node scripts/reindex.mjs --install-git-hook  # universal auto-reindex (commit/pull/checkout)
./kb            # convenience: reindex + open the offline viewer (./kb lint | ./kb stats)
```

After every change to `.md` articles, run `node scripts/reindex.mjs` so `INDEX.md` and the
viewer stay fresh. (Claude does this automatically via a hook; other tools — via the git
hooks from `--install-git-hook`, or manually.)

## How to add knowledge well

1. Required frontmatter: `title`, `slug`, `category`, `summary`, `status`, `author`. Model in `_templates/`.
2. `summary` = one concrete sentence (the only thing the assistant sees in the index).
3. Granularity (file vs row): if the thing has its own lifecycle — updates independently, has its own owner/ID, someone may need only it — give it its own `.md`. If it's a small annotation, make it a row/section inside a parent article. Don't shard trivia; don't bury independent things.
4. Quality filter: keep only what passes "would an LLM querying this in 6 months actually use it?". Record facts with their source; mark hypotheses/assumptions as such; drop paraphrase, speculation, raw code, secrets.
5. Transcribe first: turn screenshots / diagrams / charts into text before saving — the base is text the LLM reads.
6. Provenance (optional): `source` + `authority` (`primary`/`secondary`/`derived`) per the folder's `BRIEF.md`.
7. Link liberally via `[[slug]]`.
7b. **Make implicit meaning findable:** add `aka:` synonyms, and optionally a `## Questions it
    answers` section listing the questions/phrasings the article answers — so a search by meaning
    (grep / query expansion) hits it even when the wording differs from the body.
8. Human-in-the-loop: propose the article (path + content) and get an explicit OK before writing. Outsource the thinking, not the understanding.
9. Open `viewer.html` to browse the base like a human.

## Findability metadata (so retrieval stays good at scale)

- **`summary`** is the retrieval surface — write it with real keywords (the agent sees only this in
  the index). **`tags`** for facets; **`entities: [client, product, person]`** for cross-cutting
  lookup (a client/product referenced from many articles). Both feed `INDEX-facets.md`.
- **`aka: [synonym, synonym]`** — optional aliases for an article (e.g. the owner profile
  `aka: [boss, owner]`). They go into the index line and the viewer search, so grep/search hit
  alternative phrasings.
- The base is **grep-first**: plain Markdown + ripgrep scales to huge bases with zero infra. The
  index is the map; grep / `INDEX-facets.md` is the lookup. No vector DB — keeps it tool-agnostic.
- **`GAPS.md`** (generated) lists every `⚠` flag, draft and stale article. Agents: treat `⚠` items
  as UNKNOWN — never present them as fact. It's the user's fill-in to-do list.

## Lifecycle & archiving (keep the base "effectively small")

- `status:` lifecycle: `draft` → `stable` → `archived`. **`status: archived`** keeps the file on
  disk (still grep-able, still in the viewer) but drops it from the index listings, so dead/finished
  things don't clutter retrieval. To revive, set it back to `stable`.
- `--lint` flags **stale** articles (`updated` older than 6 months) — review and refresh or archive.

## Capture loop (context compounds with use)

The base's edge over a memoryless chat is that it remembers. As you work WITH the owner, write the
durable bits back — cheaply:
- New durable knowledge → refine the relevant article IN PLACE (don't append a changelog).
- A meeting with outcomes → `meetings/`; a decision that changes how we work → `D-NNN`.
- Keep **`now.md`** current — update it when the focus shifts.
- One line in `wiki/log/log-<author>.md` per change. At the end of a working session, briefly
  propose what's worth persisting, then capture it on an OK.

## Identity, decisions & history (shared base)

- Author from Git, no second source of truth: your author slug comes from `git config user.email` mapped via `roster` in `knowledge.config.json`. Stamp it as `author:` in each article you add, so the file's author matches the commit's author. If your email isn't in the roster, add it.
- `wiki/decisions.md` — append-only log of decisions that shape the base or how the team works (D-NNN: who, decision, why, consequences). Never edit past entries.
- `wiki/log/log-<slug>.md` — your personal append-only activity log; add one line per change. Everyone writes only to their own file → no merge conflicts.
