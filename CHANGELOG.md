# Changelog

## 0.16.0

- **Onboarding for non-technical clients & multi-company use** — each company gets its OWN private repo under THEIR account/organization. /kb-setup now: (a) if the user has no GitHub account, guides them through creating one (and optionally a company Organization) instead of silently falling back to a local-only base; (b) when bases already exist, offers to open one, join a different company, or set up a NEW base for a different company (for people/consultants running several) — never merging two companies into one base.

## 0.15.0

- **Detect-first onboarding** — `/kb-setup` and `/kb-init` now look for an existing base BEFORE asking anything. New `install.mjs --list` reports every base already on the machine (shared registry + ~/knowledge scan) with names, detected tools and which tool adapters are installed — so a base set up in one app (Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity) is reused, not duplicated, when you set up another.
- **Clearer, hand-held flow** — one friendly question covers the three cases (have a link = JOIN / it is elsewhere = connect / nobody uses one = NEW); the agent runs everything, confirms before creating, and never starts a fresh base when one already exists. JOIN still inherits company/language/departments; NEW asks only name + writing language.

## 0.14.2

- **License clarity** — added a `license: MIT` field to the plugin manifest and a visible attribution line in the README. The project stays **MIT**: free to use, modify and deploy in your organization, provided the copyright/attribution notice (Adrian Skobiej) is kept on reuse or modification.

## 0.14.1

- **Added RELEASING.md** — a maintainer guide for shipping a change so code, version, git tags, GitHub Releases and descriptions stay in sync (bumping the version alone is not a release). README points to it; Changelog line no longer hardcodes a stale version.

## 0.14.0

- **Per-zone procedures shipped in the starter** — every zone now includes a `BRIEF.md` (projects, skills, people, meetings, concepts, departments) describing what belongs there and the step-by-step add procedure (dedup-first, which template, required frontmatter incl. `type`, linking, reindex, log). New bases get the mechanics out of the box instead of empty zones.

## 0.13.0

- **OKF-compatible (Open Knowledge Format)** — every concept now carries a `type` (the one field OKF requires): the engine honors an explicit `type:` and otherwise derives it from the zone (projects-Project, skills-Skill, people-Person, meetings-Meeting, concepts-Concept, departments-Department), so bundles are OKF-conformant out of the box and interoperate with the OKF ecosystem. Added optional `resource:` (canonical URL/repo), shown in the viewer. Templates carry `type`. We keep our own conventions (wikilinks, rich paginated index) on top — OKF is permissive. No GCP/Dataplex tooling involved.

## 0.12.1

- **Base `version` no longer drifts** — the template config starts at the current version and onboarding (`/kb-init`, `/kb-setup`) stamps a NEW base's `version` from the installed plugin's version, so a base records which engine created it instead of a stale default.

## 0.12.0

- **Onboarding now branches NEW vs JOIN, and asks the writing language** — `/kb-setup` and `/kb-init` first decide whether you are creating a NEW base or JOINING an existing org base, and that gates the questions. **NEW base:** asks the company name and the **preferred content language** (sets `company.language`, the default everyone inherits) and seeds `CONTEXT.md`. **JOIN:** inherits company name, departments and language from the existing base — no setup questions, just who-you-are. Joiners are added to the `roster`. The end-of-setup tips now mention `/kb-find` and `/kb-new-project`.

## 0.11.0

- **Dedup & update check before adding** — agents now check the base (search-by-meaning) BEFORE adding any entry. If nothing covers it, add normally; if something does, compare and — when the new info changes something — show existing vs new and **ask the user whether to update or keep**, then refine in place (no duplicate file, no changelog). Contradictions are surfaced, not silently resolved. Keeps the base de-duplicated and trustworthy with many contributors. Wired into `/kb-ingest` and `AGENTS.md`.

## 0.10.1

- **Content language is the contributor's choice** — replaced the rigid "English only" content rule with "write in your company's working language"; mixed languages within one base are fine. The interface/structure (viewer, engine, AGENTS.md, frontmatter keys, slugs) stays English.

## 0.10.0

- **Search by meaning — no vector DB** — `/kb-find` now does **query expansion**: the agent brainstorms synonyms / related terms / phrasings (using the glossary to map concepts to the base's real terms), then greps all of them — semantic-style retrieval with the LLM as the engine, zero infra and nothing leaving the base. Plain keyword search missed things written in different words; this bridges the vocabulary gap.
- **`## Questions it answers` section** — optional article/template section listing the questions an article answers, so a meaning-based search hits it even when the body wording differs.

## 0.9.0

- **Zone-index pagination — bounded files at any scale** — a zone with more than 150 articles is split into `<zone>/INDEX.pN.md` pages (≤150 each), with `<zone>/INDEX.md` becoming a small table-of-contents (title ranges). No generated index file grows unbounded: root map ~1 KB, zone TOC ~1 KB, each page ≤ ~35 KB — so no single agent read blows up context, even at thousands of articles across many contributors. `INDEX-facets.md`/`GAPS.md` documented as grep targets. Benchmark: 2000 articles reindex in ~0.25s; generated indexes are gitignored so concurrent contributors never hit merge conflicts on them.

## 0.8.1

- **Viewer renderer fix** — Markdown tables now render as real `<table>` elements (previously shown as raw `| ... |` text). Added table styling. Engine benchmark: reindex of 2000 articles in ~0.13s, root index stays ~1 KB.

## 0.8.0

- **`GAPS.md` — incomplete/unverified to-do list** — `reindex` generates a punch-list of every `⚠` flag, draft and stale article, surfaced in the root map. Agents are told to treat `⚠` items as UNKNOWN (not fact), which cuts confidently-wrong answers; the user gets a fill-in checklist.
- **Aliases — `aka:` frontmatter** — optional synonyms for an article (e.g. the owner profile `aka: [boss, owner]`) folded into the index line and the viewer search, so grep/search hit alternative phrasings.
- **`kb` launcher** — a zero-dependency shell script: `./kb` reindexes and opens the offline viewer; `./kb lint` / `./kb stats` for health-check/stats. Easier human access without an agent.
- **Viewer search** now also matches `aka` and `entities`.

## 0.7.0

- **Facets — `INDEX-facets.md` + `/kb-find`** — `reindex` generates a tag → articles and entity → articles index from a new optional `entities: [client, product, person]` frontmatter field, so you can jump to "everything about <client>" in one hop. New `/kb-find` command does a precise lookup via grep or facets instead of loading whole indexes.
- **Lifecycle & archiving** — `status:` flows `draft → stable → archived`. `status: archived` keeps a file on disk (still grep-able, still in the viewer) but drops it from the index listings, so finished/dead items don't clutter retrieval; the root index shows an archived count. `--lint` already flags stale (>6 months) articles.
- **Capture loop** — `AGENTS.md` now instructs agents to write durable bits back as they work (refine the article in place, log meetings/decisions, keep `now.md` current) so context compounds with use.
- Still zero-infra and tool-agnostic — Markdown + ripgrep, no vector DB.

## 0.6.0

- **Scale-ready hierarchical index** — `reindex` now writes a small **root `INDEX.md` map** (zones + counts + "Start here" + briefs) plus a **per-zone `<zone>/INDEX.md`** listing. Agents read the map, open only the zone they need, then 1–5 articles — so retrieval stays fast even with hundreds/thousands of articles (the root inlines full listings only while the base is small, ≤40 articles).
- **Always-on core context** — new `CONTEXT.md` (compact: who the owner is, goals, active work, preferences, how to navigate) and `now.md` (current focus), surfaced as "Start here" and read first every session. Gives the agent maximum situational awareness without loading the whole base.
- **Grep-first lookup** — `AGENTS.md` documents grepping titles/summaries/tags for precise lookups at scale (plain Markdown + ripgrep, zero infra — no vector DB, stays tool-agnostic).
- **`.gitignore`** — whitelists `CONTEXT.md`/`now.md`, ignores generated `*/INDEX.md`.

## 0.5.0

- **Two new zones: `skills/` and `meetings/`** — skills (Claude skills) and meeting records (date, attendees, decisions, action items) are now first-class entity types alongside `projects/`, `people/`, `concepts/`, `departments/`. Engine `CONTENT_DIRS` updated; new `_templates/skill.md` and `_templates/meeting.md`.
- **`/kb-new-project` — project onboarding interview** — creating a project is an interview, not a silent stub: the agent asks for description, goal, status, repo/dir/URL, stack, ✅ in-scope and ⛔ non-goals (a HARD boundary), marks unknowns `⚠ TBD`, proposes, then writes `projects/<slug>.md`.
- **Richer project template** — `_templates/project.md` now carries What it is / Goal / Status / Repo / Stack plus explicit ✅ in-scope and ⛔ out-of-scope (non-goals) guardrail sections.
- **Multi-agent contract in `AGENTS.md`** — an explicit "Every agent works the same way" section so Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex and Cowork all read the owner profile first and follow the same project/knowledge/logging rules.
- **English-only content rule** — all knowledge-base content is written in English regardless of the conversation language; unknowns flagged `⚠ TBD`.

## 0.4.0

- **`/kb-stats` + `reindex --stats`** — base health at a glance: article counts per section and per author, drafts, orphans, and stale articles. Read-only.
- **Stale detection** — `--lint` now flags articles whose `updated` is older than 6 months (knowledge rot).
- **Config validation + louder errors** — `knowledge.config.json` is validated (`roster` must be an object, `departments` an array) and parse failures surface as health-check warnings instead of being silently swallowed.
- **CI hardening** — Node version matrix (18 / 20 / 22) and a separate secret-scan job (`scripts/check-secrets.mjs`, zero-dependency, high-signal patterns).
- **viewer.html** — a "Recently updated" section, search now also matches author + status, and a defense-in-depth CSP meta (blocks `<base>` hijack, plugins/embeds, form exfil).

## 0.3.1

- **Test suite** (`node --test`, zero dependencies) covering the engine (INDEX/kb-data build, author surfacing, XSS sanitization, `</script>` escaping, whitelist `.gitignore`, `--lint`, git-hook install) and the installer (per-tool adapters, Codex frontmatter, idempotent global awareness, `--dry-run`). Run with `npm test`.
- **CI** (GitHub Actions): syntax check + tests + template lint on every push/PR.
- **Hardening:** `viewer.html` now HTML-escapes slugs when building backlink `href`s, closing a narrow DOM-XSS path where a crafted article slug could break out of the attribute (found while writing the tests).

## 0.3.0

Adopted battle-tested ideas from a sibling system (ContextHub):

- **Whitelist `.gitignore`** — the base ignores everything by default and shares only the knowledge zones. Raw source material (`raw/`), stray files, exported data and secrets stay local and can never leak to the remote; sharing requires an explicit edit. Security by default.
- **Sharper ingestion** (`/kb-ingest` + `AGENTS.md`) — entity-granularity rule (own lifecycle → own file, else a row in a parent), the "would an LLM querying this in 6 months actually use it?" filter, facts-with-source, marked hypotheses, transcribe visuals first, and an explicit propose→accept step before writing.
- **Author from Git** — author slug derived from your git email via a `roster` in `knowledge.config.json`, stamped as `author:` in each article and shown in `INDEX.md` + the viewer. File author matches commit author; no second source of truth.
- **Decisions & history** — `wiki/decisions.md` (append-only `D-NNN`: who / decision / why / consequences) and per-person `wiki/log/log-<slug>.md` activity logs (everyone writes only to their own file → no merge conflicts).

## 0.2.0

**Rebase-safe team sync — multiple contributors, one base, nobody's entries lost.**

- `/kb-sync` now integrates teammates' work with `git pull --rebase --autostash` instead of `--ff-only`. It replays your local commits on top of the team's and restores uncommitted edits — so syncing never stalls and never discards your changes.
- `/kb-deploy` pulls (rebase) before pushing, so your push is additive and isn't rejected when someone pushed first.
- Conflicts only occur if two people edit the *same* file; in that case the commands STOP for manual resolution and never force or discard. Different articles are different files, so normal additions merge cleanly.
- Generated `INDEX.md` / `kb-data.js` stay git-ignored → zero merge noise.

Workflow recap for a shared private base: each person keeps a local clone, adds knowledge, `/kb-deploy` to push, `/kb-sync` to pull others' additions. Same base from Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, or Cowork.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- Markdown is the source of truth; zero-dependency `scripts/reindex.mjs` compiles a lightweight `INDEX.md` (for LLMs) and a standalone offline `viewer.html` (for humans).
- Tool-agnostic: every base ships an `AGENTS.md`; `install.mjs` installs `/kb-*` command adapters for Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity and sets up cross-project global awareness; git-hook auto-reindex for non-Claude tools.
- `/kb-*` commands with natural-language triggering (`init`, `setup`, `ingest`, `query`, `lint`, `sync`, `deploy`).
- "Data room" layer: source provenance & authority, per-folder briefs, conflict/gap reports, code-enforced protected quotes.
- Security: the Markdown→HTML renderer escapes `& < > " '` and allows only `http`/`https`/`mailto`/anchor/relative URLs (no stored XSS in `viewer.html`); `kb-data.js` escapes `</script>`.
- English-only; MIT licensed.
